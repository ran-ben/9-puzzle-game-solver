# 9-puzzle game solver
 An 9-puzzle game solver created with Processing 3


## Introduction

Given a specific configuration, the solver will find the cheapest solution (if it exists) to the game.

The solver implements the A* search algorithm and compares its execution time and visited nodes number according to two classical heuristics

1. **Heuristic 1 :** considers the misplaced tiles
2. **Heuristic 2 :** euclidean distance between two tiles


## Prerequisites

* Install Processing 3.5.*
* Install controlP5 library for Processing
